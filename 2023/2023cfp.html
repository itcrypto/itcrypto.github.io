<h3 style="margin:10px 10px 10px"><b>ITC 2023: Call For Papers</b></h3>  	
<p style="margin:10px 10px 10px"> The Conference on Information-Theoretic Cryptography deals with the design and implementation of cryptographic protocols and primitives with unconditional security guarantees and the usage of information-theoretic tools and techniques in achieving other forms of security. The conference takes a broad interpretation of this theme and encourages submissions from different communities (cryptography, information theory, coding theory, theory of computation) that have some components of security and information theory. Areas of interest include but are not restricted to: <ul style="margin:10px 10px 10px","list-style-type: circle">
    <li />Randomness extraction and privacy
    amplification
    <li />Secret sharing
    <li />Secure multi-party computation
    <li />Information-theoretic proof systems
    <li />Differential privacy
    <li />Quantum cryptography with unconditional security
    <li />Oblivious data structures
    <li />Idealized models (e.g., random oracle and generic group
    models)
    <li />Bounded-storage cryptography
    <li />Private information retrieval and
    locally-decodable codes
    <li />Authentication codes and non-malleable codes
    <li />Adversarial and noisy channels
    <li />Information-theoretic reductions
    <li />Algorithmic fairness
    <li />Adversarial and robust learning
    <li />Information-theoretic foundations of physical-layer security
  </ul>
  Papers on all technical aspects of these and related topics are
  solicited for submission. This year, we would like to encourage submissions from the information theory community; for example, from (but not restricted to) the following topics: 
  <ul style="margin:10px 10px 10px","list-style-type: circle">
    <li />Covert and Stealthy Communication
    <li />Secrecy Capacity of Communications Channels
    <li />Private Information Retrieval
    <li />Private Coded Computing
    <li />Privacy and Learning
  </ul>
  as well as the following emerging topics that have interesting interplay with information-theoretic cryptography:
  <ul style="margin:10px 10px 10px","list-style-type: circle">
    <li />Algorithmic fairness
    <li />Adversarial and robust learning
  </ul>
  We also encourage submissions from the cryptography community for papers that are not only about information-theoretic techniques. For instance, papers that prove a computationally secure construction but where the proof uses information-theoretic techniques. Or papers that offer several constructions of a primitive, some of which are information-theoretically secure.</p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 8px">
  Papers will be peer reviewed, and accepted
  papers will be published in conference proceedings and presented at
  the conference. The proceedings will be published by <a
  href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics">LIPIcs â€“
  Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics</a> under an open
  access license.</p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 8px">Continuing the successful format from ITC
2020, the conference will feature both a <b>publication track</b> and
a <b>spotlight track</b>. The publication track consists of papers
selected among the conference submissions by the program committee for
publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference. The
spotlight track consists of invited talks (not published in the
proceedings) that highlight the most exciting recent advances in
information-theoretic cryptography. Such talks can either survey an ITC-related topic that has seen exciting developments in the last couple of years, introduce emerging topics with interesting interplays with ITC or can be devoted to a significant ITC-related result that appeared in a recent paper.
</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 8px">
This year, the selection of speakers is conducted by the steering committee and the program chair and is by invitation only.
