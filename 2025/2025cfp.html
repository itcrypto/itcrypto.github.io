<p>Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Randomness extraction and privacy amplification</li>
    <li>Secret sharing and Secure multi-party computation</li>
    <li>Information-theoretic proof systems</li>
    <li>Differential privacy</li>
    <li>Quantum cryptography with unconditional security</li>
    <li>Oblivious data structures</li>
    <li>Idealized models (e.g., random oracle, generic group models, tamper-proof hardware and ideal obfuscation)</li>
    <li>Bounded-storage cryptography</li>
    <li>Private information retrieval and locally-decodable codes</li>
    <li>Authentication codes and non-malleable codes</li>
    <li>Adversarial and noisy channels</li>
    <li>Information-theoretic reductions</li>
    <li>Information-theoretic foundations of physical-layer security</li>
    <li>New information-theoretic primitives and their computational analogues</li>
    <li>Information-theoretic tools in computational reductions including black-box separations and lower bounds</li>
    <li>Provable symmetric key cryptography via information-theoretic analysis (e.g., modes of operation, hash functions, time-space trade-offs, etc).</li>
</ul>

<p>More broadly, authors are encouraged to bring their works in the theory of cryptography into an ITC-suitable form by distilling the information-theoretic core of the main result, by introducing a simplified variant of the result in an ideal model, etc.</p>

<p>Papers on all technical aspects of these and related topics are solicited for submission. Papers will be peer reviewed, and accepted papers will be published in conference proceedings and presented at the conference. The proceedings will be published by LIPIcs â€“ Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics under an open access license.</p>

<p>Continuing the successful format from previous years, the conference will feature both a publication track and a spotlight track. </p>

<p><b>The publication track</b> consists of papers selected among the conference submissions by the program committee for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference. Submit to this track <a href="2025submit.html">here</a>. </p>

<p><b>The spotlight track</b> consists of invited talks (not published in the proceedings) that survey advances in Information-Theoretic Cryptography, or present ITC results that were published in other recent conferences. Survey talks typically spotlight an ITC-related topic that has seen exciting developments in the last couple of years. Early-career researchers are welcome to nominate ITC related papers that have appeared in a recent major conference. The selection of speakers will be conducted by the program committee.</p>
 
<p>For the spotlight track, we solicit nominations from the community (self-nominations are allowed). If you would like to nominate a recent result/speaker for this track, please send a nomination email to the PC chair at <a href="mailto:itc2025chair@gmail.com">itc2025chair@gmail.com</a>.</p><br />
