      <p style="margin:0 0 8px">Information-theoretic
      cryptography aims at achieving security in the presence of
      computationally unbounded adversaries. Research on
      information-theoretic cryptography includes in particular:
      <ul>
	<li />The design and implementation of cryptographic protocols
	and primitives with unconditional security guarantees.
	<li />The usage of information-theoretic tools and techniques
      in achieving other forms of security, including security against
	computationally-bounded and quantum attackers.
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p style="margin:0 0 8px">ITC is a venue dedicated to serving two fundamental goals:
      <ol>
	<li />To present and disseminate research advances on all
	aspects of information-theoretic security.
	<li />
To foster the creation of a community bringing together researchers
      from several areas, including coding theory, information theory
      (classical and quantum), theory of computation, privacy, and
	cryptography.
	</ol>
	</p>

	<p style="margin:0 0 8px">
Areas of interest include, but are not restricted to:
	<ul>
	  <li />Secure multi-party computation
 <li />Information-theoretic reductions
 <li />Information theoretic proof systems
 <li />Idealized models (e.g.,ideal channels, random oracle, generic group model)
 <li />Bounded storage models
 <li />Secret sharing
 <li />Authentication codes and non-malleable codes
 <li />Randomness extraction and privacy amplification
 <li />Private information retrieval and locally decodable codes
 <li />Differential privacy
 <li />Quantum information processing
 <li />Information-theoretic foundations of physical-layer security
</ul>
Moreover, the conference also encourages the submisison of results from other fields of mathematics that are motivated by information-theoretic security.
