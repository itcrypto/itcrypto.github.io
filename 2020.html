<h3 style="margin:0 0 6px">ITC 2020: Call For Papers</h3>  	
<h4 style=="margin:0 0 6px">June 17-19, 2020 in Boston, MA USA</h4>
      
      <p><br>
      <p style="margin:0 0 8px">The first <i>Information-Theoretic Cryptography  (ITC)</i> conference will take place on June 17-19, 2020 in Boston, MA USA. ITC is a new conference dedicated to information-theoretic aspects of cryptography, broadly defined. See the <a href="https://itcrypto.github.io/">charter</a> for more information. 
      	
	<p style="margin:0 0 8px">
Areas of interest include, but are not restricted to:
	<ul>
	  <li />Secure multi-party computation 
 <li />Information-theoretic reductions 
 <li />Information theoretic proof systems 
 <li />Idealized models (e.g.,ideal channels, random oracle, generic group model)
 <li />Bounded storage models
 <li />Secret sharing
 <li />Authentication codes and non-malleable codes
 <li />Randomness extraction and privacy amplification
 <li />Private information retrieval and locally decodable codes
 <li />Differential privacy
 <li />Quantum information processing
 <li />Information-theoretic foundations of physical-layer security
</ul>

Papers on all technical aspects of these and related topics are solicited for submission. Accepted papers will be published in conference proceedings and presented at the conference.<br/>	<p/><br>

In addition to presentations of accepted papers, the conference will also have a <i>greatest hits</i> track, where we invite speakers to present top recent results in the area of information-theoretic cryptography. The selection of speakers will be conducted by the program committee. However, we solicit nominations from the community. If you would like to nominate a recent result for the greatest hits track, please send a nomination e-mail to the PC chair at itc2020chair@gmail.com. Self-nominations are discouraged.

<h3 style=="margin:0 0 6px">Instructions for Authors</h3>

The submission should begin with a title, followed by the names, affiliations and contact information of all authors, and a short abstract. It should contain a scholarly exposition of ideas, techniques, and results, including motivation and a clear comparison with related work. There are no other formatting requirements or page limits - it is solely up to the discretion of the authors to decide how to best present their work. It is highly recommended that authors write a good introduction, which clearly describes the main results of the paper and a high-level overview of the technical ideas.<br>
<p><br><p>

Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that was published elsewhere, or work that any of the authors has submitted in parallel to any other journal, conference, or workshop that has proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to present the paper at the conference; presentations may be recorded and made available to the public online. Authors are strongly encouraged to post full versions of their submissions in a freely accessible online repository, such as the Cryptology ePrint archive. We encourage the authors to post such a version at the time of submission. At the minimum, we expect that authors of accepted papers will post a full version of their papers by the camera-ready deadline. Titles and abstracts of accepted papers will be made public by the PC following the notification.
