<h3 style="margin:0 0 6px">ITC 2020: Call For Papers</h3>  	
<h4 style=="margin:0 0 6px">June 17-19, 2020 in Boston, MA USA</h4>
      
      <p><br>
      <p style="margin:0 0 8px">The first <i>Information-Theoretic Cryptography  (ITC)</i> conference will take place on June 17-19, 2020 in Boston, MA USA. ITC is a new conference dedicated to information-theoretic aspects of cryptography, broadly defined. See the <a href="https://itcrypto.github.io/">charter</a> for more information. 
      	
	<p style="margin:0 0 8px">
Areas of interest include, but are not restricted to:
	<ul>
 <li />Randomness extraction and privacy amplification
 <li />Secret sharing
 <li />Secure multi-party computation 
 <li />Information theoretic proof systems 
 <li />Differential privacy
 <li />Quantum information processing
 <li/> Oblivious data structures
 <li />Idealized models (e.g.,ideal channels, random oracle, generic group model)
 <li />Bounded storage models
 <li />Private information retrieval and locally decodable codes
 <li />Authentication codes and non-malleable codes
 <li /> Adversarial and noisy channels		
  <li />Information-theoretic reductions 
 <li />Information-theoretic foundations of physical-layer security
</ul>

Papers on all technical aspects of these and related topics are solicited for submission. Papers will be peer reviewed and accepted papers will be published in conference proceedings and presented at the conference.<br/>	<p/><br>

The conference will have two tracks: a <i>publication track</i> and a <i>greatest hits</i> track. The publication track operates in the usual way, where authors submit their papers and the committee selects accepted papers for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference. The greatest hits track consists of invited talks (not published in the proceedings) that highlight the most exciting recent advances in information-theoretic cryptography. Such talks can either survey an ITC-related topic that has seen exciting developments in the last couple of years or can be devoted to a significant ITC-related result that appeared in a paper recently. This will give us the opportunity to hear about the latest big developments in information-theoretic cryptography that have appeared in different venues like  FOCS/STOC, CRYPTO/EUROCRYPT/TCC, and QIP/ISIT. The selection of speakers will be conducted by the program committee and is by invitation only. However, we solicit nominations from the community. If you would like to nominate a recent result for the greatest hits track, please send a nomination e-mail to the PC chair at itc2020chair@gmail.com. Self-nominations are discouraged.

<h3 style=="margin:0 0 6px">Instructions for Authors</h3>

The submission should begin with a title, followed by the names, affiliations and contact information of all authors, and a short abstract. It should contain a scholarly exposition of ideas, techniques, and results, including motivation and a clear comparison with related work. There are no other formatting requirements or page limits - it is solely up to the discretion of the authors to decide how to best present their work. It is highly recommended that authors write a good introduction, which clearly describes the main results of the paper and a high-level overview of the technical ideas.<br>
<p><br><p>

Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that was published elsewhere, or work that any of the authors has submitted in parallel to any other journal, conference, or workshop that has proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to present the paper at the conference; presentations may be recorded and made available to the public online. Authors are strongly encouraged to post full versions of their submissions in a freely accessible online repository, such as the Cryptology ePrint archive. We encourage the authors to post such a version at the time of submission. At the minimum, we expect that authors of accepted papers will post a full version of their papers by the camera-ready deadline. Titles and abstracts of accepted papers will be made public by the PC following the notification.
