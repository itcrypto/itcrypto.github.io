<p style="margin:10px 10px 10px"> Areas of interest include, but are
  not restricted to: <ul style="margin:10px 10px 10px","list-style-type: circle">
    <li />Randomness extraction and privacy
    amplification
    <li />Secret sharing
    <li />Secure multi-party computation
    <li />Information-theoretic proof systems
    <li />Differential privacy
    <li />Quantum cryptography with unconditional security
    <li />Oblivious data structures
    <li />Idealized models (e.g., random oracle and generic group
    models)
    <li />Bounded-storage cryptography
    <li />Private information retrieval and
    locally-decodable codes
    <li />Authentication codes and non-malleable codes
    <li />Adversarial and noisy channels
    <li />Information-theoretic reductions
    <li />Information-theoretic foundations of physical-layer security
  </ul>
  Papers on all technical aspects of these and related topics are
  solicited for submission. Papers will be peer reviewed, and accepted
  papers will be published in conference proceedings and presented at
  the conference. The proceedings will be published by <a
  href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics">LIPIcs â€“
  Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics</a> under an open
  access license.</p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 8px">Continuing the successful format from ITC
2020, the conference will feature both a <b>publication track</b> and
a <b>spotlight track</b>. The publication track consists of papers
selected among the conference submissions by the program committee for
publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference. The
spotlight track consists of invited talks (not published in the
proceedings) that highlight the most exciting recent advances in
information-theoretic cryptography. Such talks can either survey an
ITC-related topic that has seen exciting developments in the last
couple of years or can be devoted to a significant ITC-related result
that appeared in a recent paper. The selection of speakers will be
conducted by the program committee and is by invitation only. However,
we solicit nominations from the community. If you would like to
nominate a recent result for the greatest hits track, please send a
nomination email to the PC chair at <a
href="mailto:itc2021chair@gmail.com">itc2021chair@gmail.com</a>. Self-nominations
are discouraged.</p><br />
