<p style="margin:0 0 8px">The second <i>Information-Theoretic
      Cryptography (ITC)</i> conference will take place on July 23-26,
      2021 in <b>Bertinoro, Italy</b>, with an option for online
      attendance (<a href="#attendance">see details below</a>). ITC is
      a conference dedicated to all information-theoretic aspects of
      cryptography, broadly defined. See the <a
      href="https://itcrypto.github.io/">charter</a> for more
      information.</p>


	<p style="margin:0 0 8px"> Areas of interest include, but are
  not restricted to: <ul>
    <li />Randomness extraction and privacy
    amplification
    <li />Secret sharing
    <li />Secure multi-party computation
    <li />Information-theoretic proof systems
    <li />Differential privacy
    <li />Quantum cryptography with unconditional security
    <li />Oblivious data structures
    <li />Idealized models (e.g., random oracle and generic group
    models)
    <li />Bounded-storage cryptography
    <li />Private information retrieval and
    locally-decodable codes
    <li />Authentication codes and non-malleable codes
    <li />Adversarial and noisy channels
    <li />Information-theoretic reductions
    <li />Information-theoretic foundations of physical-layer security
  </ul>
  Papers on all technical aspects of these and related topics are
  solicited for submission. Papers will be peer reviewed, and accepted
  papers will be published in conference proceedings and presented at
  the conference. The proceedings will be published by <a
  href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics">LIPIcs â€“
  Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics</a> under an open
  access license.</p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 8px">Continuing the successful format from ITC
2020, the conference will feature both a <b>publication track</b> and
a <b>spotlight track</b>. The publication track consists of papers
selected among the conference submissions by the program committee for
publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference. The
spotlight track consists of invited talks (not published in the
proceedings) that highlight the most exciting recent advances in
information-theoretic cryptography. Such talks can either survey an
ITC-related topic that has seen exciting developments in the last
couple of years or can be devoted to a significant ITC-related result
that appeared in a recent paper. The selection of speakers will be
conducted by the program committee and is by invitation only. However,
we solicit nominations from the community. If you would like to
nominate a recent result for the greatest hits track, please send a
nomination email to the PC chair at <a
href="mailto:itc2021chair@gmail.com">itc2021chair@gmail.com</a>. Self-nominations
are discouraged.</p><br />

<p style="margin:0 0 8px"><a name="attendance"></a><h4 style=="margin:0 0 6px">Conference
  Format</h4>

 We are planning for an in-person conference. However, the event will
be turned into an online-only event should it become clear that
in-person participation is not possible and/or unsafe. Moreover, even
in case of an in-person event, online attendance will remain possible
for speakers and other attendees who do not feel comfortable with
in-person attendance.</p><br />

<h4 style=="margin:0 0 6px">Instructions for Authors</h4>
The submission should begin with a title, followed by the names,
affiliations and contact information of all authors, and a short
abstract. It should contain a scholarly exposition of ideas,
techniques, and results, including motivation and a clear comparison
with related work to give the proper context. There are no specific
formatting requirements or page limits - it is solely up to the
discretion of the authors to decide how to best present their work to
make it easy to understand and review. It is highly recommended that
authors write a good and comprehensive introduction, which clearly
describes the main results of the paper and gives a high-level
overview of the technical ideas within the first 10 pages. (Excluding
  the title page.)<br />
 <br />

Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that was published
elsewhere, or work that any of the authors has submitted in parallel
to any other journal, conference, or workshop that has
proceedings. Throughout the review period, at least one corresponding
author is expected to be available to receive and quickly answer
questions (via email) that arise about their submissions. At least one
author of each accepted paper is required to present the paper at the
conference; presentations may be recorded and made available to the
public online. Authors are strongly encouraged to post full versions
of their submissions in a freely accessible online repository, such as
the Cryptology ePrint archive. We encourage the authors to post such a
version at the time of submission. At the minimum, we expect that
authors of accepted papers will post a full version of their papers by
the camera-ready deadline. Titles and abstracts of accepted papers
will be made public following notification.  </p>
