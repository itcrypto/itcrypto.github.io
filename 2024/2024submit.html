<p><a href="https://itcrypto24.hotcrp.com/">Submit your paper at the ITC 2024 Submission Server here.</a></p>
<!-- <p>The submission server link will be posted here closer to the submission deadline.</p> -->

<h4 style=="margin:0 0 6px"><b>Instructions for Authors</b></h4>
The submission should begin with a title, followed by the names,
affiliations and contact information of all authors, and a short
abstract. It should contain a scholarly exposition of ideas,
techniques, and results, including motivation and a clear comparison
with related work to give the proper context. There are no specific
formatting requirements or page limits - it is solely up to the
discretion of the authors to decide how to best present their work to
make it easy to understand and review. It is highly recommended that
authors write a good and comprehensive introduction, which clearly
describes the main results of the paper and gives a high-level
overview of the technical ideas within the first 10 pages. (Excluding
  the title page.)<br />
 <br />

Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that was published
elsewhere, or work that any of the authors has submitted in parallel
to any other journal, conference, or workshop that has
proceedings. Throughout the review period, at least one corresponding
author is expected to be available to receive and quickly answer
questions (via email) that arise about their submissions. At least one
author of each accepted paper is required to present the paper at the
conference; presentations may be recorded and made available to the
public online. Authors are strongly encouraged to post full versions
of their submissions in a freely accessible online repository, such as
the Cryptology ePrint archive. We encourage the authors to post such a
version at the time of submission. At the minimum, we expect that
authors of accepted papers will post a full version of their papers by
the camera-ready deadline. Titles and abstracts of accepted papers
will be made public following notification.  </p>
